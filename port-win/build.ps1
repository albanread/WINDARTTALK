# WINDART S1 build driver.
#
# Activates the MSVC 2026 x64 toolchain (vcvars64), configures the VM-core CMake
# project with Ninja, and builds it — teeing all output to build\build.log.
#
# Usage (from any normal PowerShell):
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File e:\windart\port-win\build.ps1
#   ...\build.ps1 -Clean          # wipe the build dir first (fresh configure)
#   ...\build.ps1 -Target dart_engine
#
# cl.exe is only on PATH after vcvars64, so we run cmake+ninja INSIDE the same
# `cmd /c` that sources vcvars (the env does not survive back to PowerShell).
